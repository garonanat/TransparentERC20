### SafeERC20Token
SafeERC20Token is a secure and transparent implementation of an ERC20-like token contract written in Rust, using the no_std environment for minimal dependencies. This contract includes additional safety checks and transparency features such as overflow protection and event emission.

## Features

1. Overflow Protection: The contract uses safe arithmetic (checked_add, checked_sub) to prevent overflow errors during token transfers and minting operations.

2. Balance Transfers: Tokens can be safely transferred between addresses with balance checks and validation.
   
4. Token Minting: Tokens can be minted (created) to any valid address with safe overflow checks.
 
6. Event Emission: Events are triggered on every token transfer and minting operation for full transparency on the blockchain.
   

## Functions
``balance_of(owner: Address)`` -> u64

Returns the balance of the specified address (owner).

``transfer(from: Address, to: Address, value: u64)``

Transfers value tokens from the from address to the to address. Includes checks to ensure that the from address has enough tokens and that no overflows occur.

``mint(to: Address, value: u64)``

Mints value new tokens to the to address. The operation ensures that the total balance doesnâ€™t overflow.

``emit_transfer_event(from: Address, to: Address, value: u64)``

Emits an event to record the transfer of tokens between addresses.

``emit_mint_event(to: Address, value: u64)``

Emits an event to record the minting of new tokens.

## Security Features

* Overflow Checks: All arithmetic operations use checked_add and checked_sub to prevent overflows.
  
* Revert on Error: The contract reverts transactions when invalid conditions occur, such as insufficient balance or invalid transfers.
  
* Event Logging: All important operations such as transfer and mint trigger events, providing transparency in token transactions.

## Usage
This contract is designed to be deployed on a blockchain platform that supports Rust smart contracts and the no_std environment. It can be used for creating token systems where safety, efficiency, and transparency are critical.
